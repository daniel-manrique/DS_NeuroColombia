# Introduction {.unnumbered}

Welcome to the **NeuroColombia Data Analysis** project. This book documents the complete data analysis pipeline for investigating neurodevelopmental disorder consultations in Colombia from 2016 to 2022.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze the frequency and distribution of neurodevelopmental diagnoses using public health data from the Colombian Ministry of Health and population projections from DANE.

This book is organized into the following chapters:

1.  **[Data Cleaning and Processing](0_NeuroColombia_DataCleaning.qmd)**: Details the procedures for cleaning raw data, standardizing text, and merging diagnostic records with population data.
2.  **[Consultation Frequency Analysis](1_Consultation_Frequency.qmd)**: Explores temporal trends and geographical distributions of consultations at a general level.
3.  **[Diagnostic Frequency Analysis](2_Consultation_DiagnosticFrecuency.qmd)**: Breaks down consultations by specific ICD-10 diagnostic categories to identify the most prevalent conditions.
4.  **[Deep Dive: Top 3 Diagnostics](3_Consultation_MostFrequent.qmd)**: A focused analysis of the three most frequent diagnoses (F900, F809, F808), examining their distribution by sex, age, and geography.

## Data Sources

-   **Ministry of Health**: Raw consultation records (SISPRO).
-   **DANE**: Official population projections for Colombia.

## Reproducibility

All code used in this analysis is available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/daniel-manrique/DS_NeuroColombia). The analysis is written in R and rendered using Quarto.
